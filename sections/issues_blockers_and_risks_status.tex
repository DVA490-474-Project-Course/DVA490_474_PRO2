\section{Issues, Blockers, and Risks Status}

% !!! Reference back to the project plan !!!

% Identify any issues or blockers that are currently affecting the project.
% Outline the steps being taken to mitigate these concerns.

% Identifies any problems or obstacles hindering the progress and potential risks, along with their resolution or mitigation plans.

A number of issues were identified, and in an attempt to minimise their impact on the project they were combined with a mitigation action. The issues and their corresponding mitigation plan can be seen in Table.\:\ref{tab:issues_and_mitigation}. 
\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabularx}{\columnwidth}{|X|X|} \hline
         \textbf{Issue} & \textbf{Mitigation} \\ \hline
         1.2 \& 1.6: Compilation error in centralised-ai repository after merge & Allocate additional work force to solve the problem. \\ \hline
         1.5: nav2 stack error & Enlisting Pontus Svenssons help (the only other member with \ac{ros2} and nav2 experience). Additionally, asking the question on Stack Exchange to allow external resources to help find the answer. \\ \hline
         1.3.5: Difficulty implementing \ac{spi} & Reading from multiple sources online, reading manuals and data sheets. Looking at examples provided by WÃ¼rth. Will look at the examples provided by STMicroelectronics, as well as other competitive teams such as TIGERs Mannheim and Delft Mercurians. \\ \hline
         2.1.3: Size constraints for parts & Redesigning and moving already made \ac{cad} models to make more room to fit components. \\ \hline
         1: Software modules have so far only been tested individually. There may be issues or even necessary functionality that is missing that is only apparent once integration has been attempted. & Integrate different software modules at the earliest possible moment, thus leaving time to fix any potential issues which might arise. \\ \hline
         1.1.2: Simulation is currently limited to only being able to run in real time. Without being able to control speed of simulation, the capacity to train the \ac{ai} model will be significantly reduced. & Dedicate time to try and find a way to control simulation speed. Worst case scenario, the loss of \ac{ai} performance has to be accepted. \\ \hline
         2: Components arriving late, this will delay development and testing of components. & The \textit{Hardware interface} will be implemented until the components arrive. \\ \hline
         2.2: No sponsor for \ac{pcb} manufacturing has been found. & The project will use an external \ac{pcb} supplier. \\ \hline
