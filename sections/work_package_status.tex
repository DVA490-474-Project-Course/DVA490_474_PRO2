    \item \textbf{Planning status}: On-track
    \item \textbf{Completion status}: Completed
    \item \textbf{Accountability}: Aaiza Aziz Khan, Shruthi Puthiya Kunnon, Emil Åberg
    \item \textbf{Recovery plan}: N/A
    \item \textbf{Progress}: Completed all the deliverables and tasks.
    \item \textbf{Issues}: grSim crashed suddenly and remained in an unusable state until it was fixed by following the troubleshooting instructions in the \href{https://github.com/RoboCup-SSL/grSim/blob/master/INSTALL.md}{INSTALL.md file} available in the \href{https://github.com/RoboCup-SSL/grSim}{grSim repository}. Additionally, a way to control simulation has still not been developed.
    \item \textbf{Next steps}: N/A
\end{itemize}

%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection*{1.2 \acs{ssl} interface}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Planning status}: On-track
    \item \textbf{Completion status}: Completed

    \item \textbf{Recovery plan}: N/A
    \item \textbf{Progress}: Completed all the deliverables and tasks.
    \item \textbf{Issues}: There are some limitations in how well the clients for ssl-vision and ssl-game-controller can be tested automatically and independently with Google Test; they rely on \ac{udp} streams which need to be generated while the clients are executing in parallel. Therefore, testing of \textit{\acs{ssl} interface} has been complemented with manual tests, where \textit{\acs{ssl} interface} is integrated with ssl-vision and ssl-game-controller.
    \item \textbf{Next steps}: N/A
\end{itemize}
